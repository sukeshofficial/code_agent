## ðŸ“Œ Task: I want a python program to find the factorial of the given number

### ðŸ§  Explanation
This Python program defines a function `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`. It checks if `n` is negative, in which case it returns a message stating that factorials are not defined for negative numbers. If `n` is 0 or 1, it returns 1, as the factorial of both is 1. For other positive integers, it uses a loop to multiply all integers from 2 to `n` to compute the factorial. The program also includes an example usage where it prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the factorial of that number.
