## ðŸ“Œ Task: I want a program to find a given number using binary search use the class name "BinarySearch", in java

### ðŸ§  Explanation
This Java program defines a class named `BinarySearch` that includes a method `binarySearch` to find a target number in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm. The method takes an integer array and the target number as parameters. It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current search bounds. The algorithm repeatedly calculates the middle index and compares the middle element with the target. If the target is found, it returns the index; if not, it adjusts the search bounds accordingly. The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `binarySearch` method with a sample sorted array and a target number, printing the result to the console.
