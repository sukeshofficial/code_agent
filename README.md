## ğŸ“Œ Task: I want a program to find a number using binary search, name the class as BinarySeach, in java

### ğŸ§  Explanation
This Java program defines a class named `BinarySearch` that contains a method `binarySearch` to perform the binary search algorithm on a sorted array. The method takes an array and a target number as parameters and returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if not found. The `main` method initializes a sorted array and a target number, calls the `binarySearch` method, and prints the result indicating whether the target was found and its index.
