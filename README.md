## ðŸ“Œ Task: I want a java program on binary search

### ðŸ§  Explanation
This Java program implements a binary search algorithm. The `binarySearch` method takes a sorted array and a target value as arguments. It initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively. It then enters a loop where it calculates the middle index and compares the middle element with the target. If they match, it returns the index; if the target is greater, it narrows the search to the right half, and if it's smaller, it narrows to the left half. If the target is not found, it returns -1. The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `binarySearch` method with an example sorted array and target value.
